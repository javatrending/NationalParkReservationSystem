I completed this project as a part of the Tech Elevator coding bootcamp. The requirements were as follows:

1. Display a list of parks, including their description.
2. User will be able to choose a park in Console.
3. For selected park, user will be able to see list of campgrounds in that park.
4. For selected campground, user will be able to see details of that campground and its availability.
5. The User can enter search criteria into the system and get back a list of available sites matching those criteria. Sites are unavailable if there are existing reservations for the date range the user entered.
6. The User can then reserve the site and get confirmation.

Since this wrapped up our current module, which covered postgreSQL, RDBMSs, and more, the key piece in this project was hooking up the Java application to a database. The tables we used (and the Data Access Objects in our model) represented data about the parks, campgrounds, campsites, and reservations.
